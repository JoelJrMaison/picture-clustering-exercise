before anything make sure you have python installed

then in the command line type pip install streamlit scikit-learn nltk requests beautifulsoup4

then you can run 'python scrapper.py' to make sure the file has no errors.

finally run 'streamlit run news_deployed.py' to deploy on streamlit locally

N/B: A drawback is that the clusters do not specify the type or genre of the news articles

Another drawback is that you have to use an api key in order to access the pictures of the unsplash website

do not leave your api key on your git files for security concerns
